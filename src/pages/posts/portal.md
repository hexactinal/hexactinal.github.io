Just a heads-up, this is one of my favorite games of all time, so I'm heavily biased and this
will _not_ be a fair critique! Anyways, onto the review...

Portal is incredibly atmospheric. Just look at the area that the player starts in:

I love that the whole game has this oppressive atmosphere. GLaDOS constantly taunts the player
throughout the adventure. The game is built off of a 19-chamber tutorial into an exhilirating
escape sequence:

Some other highlights from the game:
* Connection to the Half-Life games with the "Black Mesa" slideshow before the final battle.
* Rattman Dens
* Turrets
* Companion Cube <3
